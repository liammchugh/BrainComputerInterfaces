# Brain-Computer Interfaces
## BCI Guitar Pedal

Neural interface that translates brain & muscle signals into instrument effect modulation.

#### Overview
This project uses EEG (electroencephalography) and EMG (electromyography) signals to control audio effect parameters in real-time, creating a hands-free experience for musicians.

#### Instrumentation & Communication
- EMG analogue / digital signal processing.
- Embedded Zephyr/C++ RTOS development.
- Bluetooth LE-enabled comms w/sub-40Î¼s latency.

#### Ground Module: Processing & Audio Effects
- Target platforms:
    - Raspi 4/5, NVIDIA Jetson
    - NXP i.MX RT1170 microcontroller family
- Instrument Effects: Overdrive and distortion, commercial quality circuit design, bench-tested.
- Statistical ML feature processing w/engagement-based reinforcement learning development capacity.

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up development environment and hardware configurations will be added soon.
